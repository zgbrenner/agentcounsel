# Implementation Sequence

This sequence consolidates related work into small PRs that extend the current
AgentCounsel systems instead of replacing them.

> **Note:** this sequence has been largely executed. PRs 2, 3, 5, and 6 have
> shipped — see the per-PR status lines below, which also record where the
> landed artifacts differ from the file names originally proposed. PRs 1 and 4
> remain open.

## PR 1: Generated Platform Registry

Create a generated platform registry that exposes the systems AgentCounsel
already has.

Affected files:

- `scripts/build_skill_index.py` or a new `scripts/build_platform_registry.py`
- `metadata/index.json`
- new `metadata/platform.json`
- `docs/SKILL_METADATA_STANDARD.md`
- `VALIDATION.md`

Scope:

- Keep `skills/` frontmatter as the source of truth for skills.
- Generate records for skills, matter packs, matter workspaces, practice
  profiles, connectors, adapters, and eval coverage.
- Include stable IDs, paths, titles, category, platform surfaces, and validation
  status where available.
- Add validation that generated metadata is current.

Borrowing inputs:

- Use `anthropics/knowledge-work-plugins` and `mukul975/Anthropic-Cybersecurity-Skills`
  as license-compatible references for registry and pack thinking.
- Use no copied text or schemas unless separately attributed.

## PR 2: Router And Pack Manifest Improvements

Status: shipped — `metadata/router.json` and `metadata/packs.json` are
generated and checked in.

Make routing and pack outputs easier for agents and platforms to consume.

Affected files:

- `scripts/build_platform_packs.py`
- `scripts/build_skill_index.py` or `scripts/build_platform_registry.py`
- `metadata/router.json`
- `metadata/packs.json`
- `site/generate.mjs`
- `adapters/`

Scope:

- Generate `metadata/router.json` from existing frontmatter and `COMMANDS.md`.
- Generate a pack manifest with platform, practice area, included skills,
  output file names, checksums, and source paths.
- Add a thin Cursor-specific generated artifact only if the required format can
  be implemented from public facts or license-compatible sources.
- Keep ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Codex, and generic Markdown packs generated
  from canonical source files.

Borrowing inputs:

- Use `humanlayer/12-factor-agents` for high-level agent design principles.
- Treat `cursor/plugins` as inspiration only unless its license changes or
  Cursor publishes reusable specs under clear terms.

## PR 3: Legal Prose And Citation Quality Checks

Status: shipped — `scripts/check_legal_prose.py` exists and covers the scope
below.

Add automated quality checks for repository-owned outputs without introducing a
model dependency.

Affected files:

- new `scripts/check_legal_prose.py`
- `scripts/run_evals.py`
- `evals/shared/assertions.md`
- `evals/outputs/`
- `VALIDATION.md`
- `.github/workflows/validate.yml`

Scope:

- Check generated examples and eval candidate outputs for attorney-review
  framing, overclaiming, fake citation patterns, unresolved citation claims,
  vague AI-style phrasing, and missing uncertainty flags.
- Integrate with existing eval output checks.
- Keep the first version heuristic and stdlib-only.

Borrowing inputs:

- Use `hardikpandya/stop-slop` as MIT-licensed inspiration for prose-quality
  categories, but write AgentCounsel-specific legal checks independently.
- Use `harveyai/harvey-labs` as MIT-licensed inspiration for legal benchmark
  discipline, not as a source of copied eval content.

## PR 4: Connector And Source-Validation Registry

Turn connector documentation into a machine-readable source map while keeping
connectors documentation-only.

Affected files:

- `connectors/README.md`
- `connectors/*.md`
- new `metadata/connectors.json`
- `scripts/validate_repo.py`
- `skills/legal-methodology/source-validation/SKILL.md`
- `site/generate.mjs`

Scope:

- Add a consistent metadata header or parseable table for each connector.
- Generate connector records for source, coverage, license/access model, query
  surfaces, and fallback behavior.
- Validate connector docs against the connector contract.
- Surface connectors in the site and in source-validation guidance.

Borrowing inputs:

- Use `public-api-lists/public-api-lists` for permissively licensed API-list
  organization patterns.
- Use `LearningCircuit/local-deep-research` and `mvanhorn/last30days-skill`
  as inspiration for research-source workflows, without copying search logic or
  prompt text.

## PR 5: Review Panels And Workspace Validation

Status: shipped — landed as the top-level `review-panels/` directory and
`docs/REVIEW_PANELS.md` rather than the `core/legal-review-panel.md` file
proposed below.

Make attorney review state more structured across skills, matter workspaces,
and evals.

Affected files:

- new `core/legal-review-panel.md`
- high-risk `skills/**/SKILL.md` where a review panel materially improves the
  output
- `matter-workspaces/*.md`
- `scripts/validate_repo.py`
- `evals/shared/assertions.md`

Scope:

- Define a reusable review-panel pattern: status, reviewer, unresolved
  authority, unresolved facts, deadlines, privilege/confidentiality, source
  checks, and sign-off state.
- Add the pattern first to high-risk and critical skills, then expand only
  where it improves reviewability.
- Validate that high-risk skills either use the panel or explain why their
  existing Attorney Verification Checklist is sufficient.

Borrowing inputs:

- Use `AnttiHero/lavern`, `prowler-cloud/prowler`, and `OpenBMB/ChatDev` as
  inspiration for human gates, evidence-backed checks, and review loops.
- Do not import multi-agent debate machinery into the core Markdown library.

## PR 6: Optional Local App Path Design

Status: shipped — landed as `docs/LOCAL_PLATFORM_PATH.md` rather than the
`docs/LOCAL_APP_PATH.md` file proposed below.

Design, but do not immediately build, an optional local/self-hosted app that
consumes the generated registry and Markdown library.

Affected files:

- new `docs/LOCAL_APP_PATH.md`
- `docs/PLATFORM_GAP_ANALYSIS.md`
- optional prototype under a future app directory only after design approval

Scope:

- Keep the core repository usable as plain Markdown.
- Define app boundaries: local file ingestion, registry consumption, offline
  storage, matter workspace editing, review panels, and connector launch links.
- Decide whether the app belongs in this repository or a separate companion
  repo before implementation.

Borrowing inputs:

- Use `localForage/localForage`, `mudler/LocalAI`, `iOfficeAI/AionUi`,
  `zakirullin/files.md`, and `awesome-selfhosted/awesome-selfhosted` as
  references for optional local/offline/self-hosted paths.
- Treat GPL/AGPL and share-alike sources as inspiration only.

## Churn Controls

- Do not duplicate canonical skill content in new registries or adapters.
- Prefer generated JSON manifests over hand-maintained parallel indexes.
- Keep scripts standard-library-only unless a PR explicitly introduces an
  optional app package with its own dependency boundary.
- Add validation in the same PR that introduces a new generated artifact.
- Update `NOTICE` only when external code, prose, schemas, prompts, templates,
  examples, or eval content is copied or closely adapted.
