# AgentCounsel Skill Specification v2

Skill Specification v2 adds a typed execution contract to AgentCounsel without replacing the existing Markdown skill format.

Every canonical skill continues to use:

```text
skills/<practice-area>/<skill-slug>/SKILL.md
```

A skill may also include:

```text
skills/<practice-area>/<skill-slug>/SPEC.json
```

`SKILL.md` remains the canonical human-readable workflow. `SPEC.json` is an optional, canonical overlay for fields that benefit from explicit types, stable IDs, execution modes, safety gates, evidence requirements, and selective module loading.

The generated registry is:

```text
metadata/skill_specs.json
```

Do not edit that file by hand.

## Phase 2A coverage

The current registry contains typed execution contracts for all **212 canonical skills**. Of those, **209** use safe contracts compiled entirely from their existing Markdown metadata and **three** use reviewed custom sidecars:

- `contracts/nda-review`
- `legal-research/legal-research-memo`
- `privacy/breach-response-workflow`

No existing `SKILL.md` body was changed to establish this foundation. Future sidecars should be added incrementally in risk- and usage-priority order.

## Why a JSON sidecar

AgentCounsel's YAML frontmatter deliberately supports only top-level scalars and lists. That keeps the library portable and parseable with the Python standard library. Typed inputs, nested gates, evidence records, and mode-specific behavior require a deeper structure, so v2 uses JSON rather than expanding the frontmatter parser or adding a YAML dependency.

## Backward compatibility

A custom sidecar is not required. `scripts/build_skill_specs.py` compiles every existing skill into a safe v2 contract using:

- the eleven existing frontmatter fields;
- derived jurisdiction and deadline gates;
- the generated quality-check mapping;
- conservative input and output type inference;
- baseline inheritance, evidence, and attorney-review controls.

A sidecar enriches those defaults. It does not replace the skill wholesale.

## Baseline controls that cannot be weakened

Every compiled contract inherits:

- `core/legal-work-product.md`
- `core/source-and-citation-discipline.md`
- `core/output-format-rules.md`
- `core/attorney-review-checklist.md`

`core/jurisdiction-and-deadline-gates.md` is added whenever jurisdiction or deadline handling is required.

A custom sidecar cannot:

- make attorney review optional;
- continue substantive work when required inputs are missing;
- permit the agent to calculate a legal deadline;
- allow a required legal input to be inferred;
- remove baseline evidence fields;
- remove baseline inherited safety rules;
- make an output artifact exempt from attorney review.

The compiler rejects any sidecar that attempts these changes.

## Compiled contract fields

### `schema_version`

Always `2.0`.

### `skill_id`

The stable `<practice-area>/<skill-slug>` ID. When included in a sidecar, it must match the directory.

### `inherits`

Additional repository files whose rules apply to the skill. A sidecar adds to the baseline inheritance set; it cannot subtract from it.

### `gates`

Normalized execution boundaries:

- `missing_inputs.behavior` is always `stop-and-ask`.
- `attorney_review.required` is always `true` for current skills.
- `jurisdiction.required` indicates whether jurisdiction must be confirmed.
- `deadline.required` indicates whether dates or clocks require attention.
- `deadline.calculation_allowed` is always `false`.
- `escalation.minimum` reflects the skill's risk.
- `custom` contains skill-specific gates.

Custom gate actions are:

- `flag`
- `stop-and-ask`
- `stop-and-escalate`
- `require-attorney-confirmation`

Each custom gate needs a stable ID, an observable condition, an action, and a reason.

### `execution_modes`

Every compiled contract contains:

| Mode | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `quick-triage` | Confirm applicability, missing inputs, top issues, and escalation without generating the full work product. |
| `standard` | Produce the normal attorney-ready draft. |
| `deep-review` | Load applicable modules and run expanded completeness and verification checks. |

A sidecar may disable a mode when the limited mode would be unsafe. It must still retain all three mode records so consumers can distinguish “unsupported” from “unknown.”

### `input_schema`

Each input has:

- `id`
- `label`
- `type`
- `required`
- `description`
- `source_requirement`
- `may_infer`
- `sensitive`
- optional `enum` values

Allowed types:

```text
text, document, document-set, enum, date, datetime, boolean,
integer, number, jurisdiction, object
```

Required inputs must set `may_infer` to `false`.

To refine a legacy input, use the generated stable input ID. To add a new input, provide every required field.

### `output_schema`

Each output artifact has:

- `id`
- `label`
- `type`
- `required`
- `description`
- `attorney_review_required`

Allowed types:

```text
section, table, checklist, memo, letter, tracker, timeline,
matrix, structured-data
```

Every current output artifact requires attorney review.

### `evidence_schema`

All skills use a claim-support record. Baseline required fields are:

- `claim_id`
- `source_document_id`
- `locator`
- `support_type`
- `verification_status`

A sidecar may require additional fields such as `support_text`, `authority_status`, or `fact_as_of`. It cannot remove baseline fields.

### `modules`

Modules identify context that should be loaded only when relevant. They do not execute code.

Allowed kinds:

- `reference`
- `template`
- `profile`
- `connector`
- `quality-check`
- `workflow-module`

Every module path must resolve to an existing repository file. `load_when` must state the condition or mode that justifies loading it.

### `quality_checks`

Additional quality-check IDs appended to the generated baseline checks. Mode-specific checks belong on the corresponding execution mode.

## Authoring workflow

1. Start from `docs/templates/SPEC_TEMPLATE.json`.
2. Set `skill_id` to the exact directory-derived ID.
3. Add only fields that genuinely need refinement; inherited legacy records remain available automatically.
4. Use stable IDs. When overriding an inferred input or output, copy its ID from `metadata/skill_specs.json`.
5. Declare only repository paths that already exist.
6. Keep required legal inputs non-inferable.
7. Use gates for observable stop, escalation, or confirmation boundaries—not for legal conclusions.
8. Regenerate and validate:

```bash
python scripts/build_skill_specs.py
python scripts/build_skill_specs.py --check
python -m unittest tests.test_skill_spec_v2 tests.test_build_skill_specs tests.test_real_skill_specs -v
python scripts/check_all.py
```

## Migration strategy

Phase 2A compiles all legacy skills and provides three reviewed pilots:

- `contracts/nda-review`
- `legal-research/legal-research-memo`
- `privacy/breach-response-workflow`

Additional skills should be migrated in risk- and usage-priority order. A sidecar should be added when it materially improves at least one of:

- input validation;
- output consistency;
- safety gating;
- evidence traceability;
- execution-mode behavior;
- selective context loading.

Do not create sidecars merely to duplicate frontmatter in a second format.

## Generated JSON Schema

`specs/skill-spec-v2.schema.json` documents the compiled contract's structural shape. Repository validation in `scripts/skill_spec_v2.py` is authoritative for cross-field and non-weakening safety rules that JSON Schema alone cannot express.
